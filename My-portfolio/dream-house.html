            <p> First, I would like it to be on a subdivision which is located on a hill. The walls that surround my house will be made of hard bricks which can stand any temperature and has a color of black and white. The gate will be 9 meters away from my house. The gate is made of a strong fence painted with black. Everything in my house is computerized including my little garden which have an automatic machine that water the plants, and gives humid, and also gives the exact temperature so that the plants would not get welt or got dry which is placed in front of my house.

                Before I describe what is inside in my house I would like to describe what is behind the lock of my main door and my windows. My main door will be made of hard wood with a simple design of wood carve. The lock of my door is programmed so to open the door I should use a USB as a key. My windows are made of bullet proof glass and also it is secured, when something happens it will automatically close by itself. And now when you get inside after entering the main door you can sight a big living room with a fluffy big couch fronting a big flat screen TV on the left side of the room. On the right side of the living room the floor is different because its a glass and below it is an aquarium. On the wall, there would be a big portrait of my family but it is not really a portrait. It is actually a door, and inside on it is a big room where you can see a fountain and a stairs.  After the living room, you can sight the kitchen. On the left side of the kitchen you can see the materials for cooking, the kitchen sink, the cabinets and a big sliding door, which will lead you to the swimming pool. The right side of the kitchen is where the table and chairs are placed and another door that leads you to the comfort room.
 
                I will describe to you the second floor. Before going to the second floor you should take the stairs behind the secret door which is covered by our family portrait.The second floor contains 5 rooms. The first room which  is painted in a light pink color is the bedroom. The second room which is painted in an artistic way is a room for arts. The third room which is painted in white is the music room. The fourth room which is painted in a light green color is the guest room and the last room which is the fifth room and the larger than any other room that is painted in a golden color is the library. There will be a balcony too. And that is all for my dream house, as I say it is simple yet elegant.
